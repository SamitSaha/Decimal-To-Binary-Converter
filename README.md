# Decimal To Binary Converter

Recursion is a programming concept where a function calls itself. This can reduce a complex problem into simpler sub-problems, until they become straightforward to solve. In this project, Iâ€™ll build a decimal-to-binary converter using JavaScript. know about the fundamental concepts of recursion, explore the call stack, and build out a visual representation of the recursion process through an animation..

you'll build a decimal and binary converter and learn about both number systems. I'll also learn about recursion by using it to perform the conversions.
